# Rest-Countries-Postman-Collection
This repository contains a Postman collection, RestCountries.postman_collection.json, which is used to test the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/). The collection includes various API requests to retrieve country data, such as name, population, and region information, etc.

Additionally, the repository is configured with a GitHub Action workflow to automate the testing of the API collection using Newman, the command-line tool for running Postman collections. The workflow ensures that tests are automatically executed via schedule on multiple OS.
