# Rest-Countries-Postman-Collection
This repository contains a Postman collection, RestCountries.postman_collection.json, which is used to test the REST Countries API. The collection includes various API requests to retrieve country data, such as name, population, and region information, etc.

Additionally, the repository is configured with a GitHub Action workflow to automate the testing of the API collection using Newman, the command-line tool for running Postman collections. The workflow ensures that tests are automatically executed via schedule.
